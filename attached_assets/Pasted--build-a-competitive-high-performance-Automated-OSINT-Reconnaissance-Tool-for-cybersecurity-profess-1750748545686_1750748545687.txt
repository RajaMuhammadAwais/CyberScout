 build a competitive, high-performance Automated OSINT Reconnaissance Tool for cybersecurity professionals, threat hunters, red teamers, and bug bounty researchers. The tool should automate multi-vector reconnaissance across internet-facing and dark web data sources.
This tool must rival existing industry tools like SpiderFoot, Recon-ng, theHarvester, and Amass, while solving their limitations: lack of concurrency, poor chainability, limited CLI control, and poor integration across modules.

üîç Use Case Overview:
Primary Objective: Automate the collection of publicly available intelligence across multiple vectors ‚Äî domain, emails, social media, leaked credentials ‚Äî for a given target (example.com, usernames, etc.).

üí° Target Differentiators (Compared to Competitors):
Concurrency-first architecture using Go to achieve scalable data scraping

Python scripting for extensibility, using Selenium/requests/bs4 for modern web sources (e.g., social media)

CLI-driven modular orchestration supporting chainable flags (--dns --emails --social --dorks)

Output in structured formats (JSON/CSV) with optional colorized terminal views

Ready for integration into CI/CD pipelines or internal security scanners

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture:
CLI Core Controller (Python)

Uses argparse to parse target, modules, output formats

Manages task flow, error handling, and logging

Concurrent Recon Modules (Go)

DNS Enumeration (dns_enum.go) ‚Äî Resolves A, NS, MX, TXT concurrently using goroutines

Breach Finder (breach_checker.go) ‚Äî Queries public breach data and exposed paste sites

Web + Social Intelligence Modules (Python)

social_scraper.py: Uses Selenium/requests to scrape Twitter (X), LinkedIn, etc. for employee or company mentions

google_dorker.py: Executes and parses Google dorks to locate GitHub leaks, pastebin dumps, etc.

Orchestration & Communication Layer

Runs Go binaries from Python via subprocess, or use gRPC/REST if scaling

Output Formatter

Aggregates data, removes duplicates, saves in JSON and CSV

Pretty terminal output with rich or tabulate

üîß Prompt Task:
Build a proof-of-concept for this OSINT tool with the following:

Define a clean and scalable project structure separating Go modules and Python orchestration

Implement a CLI in main.py that:

Accepts chainable arguments like --target example.com --dns --emails --dorks

Launches modules asynchronously

Create a Go module (dns_enum.go) that:

Accepts domain input and concurrently resolves A, MX, TXT, NS records

Returns JSON or prints clean terminal output

Create a Python module (google_dorker.py) that:

Accepts target and search profile

Queries using pre-built Google dorks (e.g., site:pastebin.com intext:example.com)

Parses results and filters by relevance

Create a unified results output manager

Include:

Folder structure

Sample CLI usage

Sample outputs (JSON and terminal)

Best practices in secure coding, rate limiting, and scraping ethics

Bonus if:

Includes Docker support

Includes tests or static analysis

Uses concurrency patterns that allow future integration of AI summarizers
